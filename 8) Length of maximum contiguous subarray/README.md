Problem-

Find maximal contiguous subarray that contains atmost k 1's and print its length.

Input-

The first line of input contains number of tests t(t<100). Each test consists of two lines. In the first n and k appears (0<n<=5*(10^5), k<=(10^4), k<=n) while in the second there is a binary sequence of length n.

Output-
For each test print the length of the maximal subarray that contains atmost k 1's.


Example-

sample input-

3
10 1
0101000001
12 2
010110101001
15 3
101000011100100

expected output -
