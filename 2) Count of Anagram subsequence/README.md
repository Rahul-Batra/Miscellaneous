Given a string S, find the count of anagram sub-sequences from S of length 3 or more . Two or more strings are anagrams if they comprise of 
exactly the same characters in different order. For Example: The strings ABC, CAB, BCA are anagrams
Your program should accept the string S from the console and write the count of anagram sub-sequences as output to the console.

Illustration 1:
Consider an input sequence
ABCDEFCBAHIBAC

Output 
1

In the above case there is only one sub-sequence of length 3 ore more i.e. ABC with anagrams CBA and BAC. 

Illustration 2:
Consider an input sequence
ABHIKGKHIBA


Output:
5

In the above case there are five sub-sequence of length 3 ore more i.e. 
ABHIK - KHIBA
ABHI - HIBA
BHIK - KHIB
BHI - HIB
HIK - KHI
